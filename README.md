# Classifier-Analyzer-Streamlit-App
🚀 Excited to share my latest data science project on classification using various machine learning algorithms! 📊

🔍 Project Overview:
I recently explored classification using three different classifiers (KNN, SVM, Random Forest) on three diverse datasets (Iris, Wine, Breast Cancer) to analyze their performance and uncover insights. Here's a brief overview:


🛠️ Tools Used:
- Streamlit for building an interactive user interface.
- scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.
- Python for coding and data manipulation.
- 

📊 Data Visualization:
I used Streamlit to create an interactive visualization that helps understand the dataset distribution. Check it out in the section below!


💡 This project demonstrates the power of data science in making informed decisions. Feel free to explore the code and results on my profile!
